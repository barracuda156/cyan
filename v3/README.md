## Color profiles

ICC color profiles are essential for using Cyan. Fallback ICC color profiles are included, but it's recommended that you at least install the [Adobe ICC profiles](https://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/iccprofiles/icc_eula_win_end.html) (or similar) for a basic set of general ICC color profiles.
