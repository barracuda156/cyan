## FAQ

### Why v3 and not v2?

v2 already exists, it ended up as a draft for another project (pixelcore) and was more or less a distraction for Cyan. So, we are starting this rewrite as version 3.

**This version will remain in the ``v3`` folder until the first release candidate, then it will replace version 1.x in ``main``.**
