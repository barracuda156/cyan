# Cyan

Cyan is an advanced [prepress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prepress) image viewer.

**v3 is a complete rewrite of Cyan, ETA early 2023.**

## Color profiles

Cyan requires a minimum of three (RGB/CMYK/GRAY) ICC color profiles to function. Fallback color profiles are included, but it's recommended that you install the [Adobe ICC profiles](https://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/iccprofiles/icc_eula_win_end.html).

A color calibrated monitor with available color profile is also recommended.

## FAQ

### Why v3 and not v2?

v2 already exists, it ended up as a draft for another project (pixelcore) and was more or less a distraction for Cyan. So, we are starting this rewrite as version 3.

**This version will remain in the ``v3`` folder until the first release candidate, then it will replace version 1.x in ``main``.**
